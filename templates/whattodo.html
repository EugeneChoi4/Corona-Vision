						Here are some things you can do:
					</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Leave a 6-foot space between yourself and others.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							Six feet is like...<br/>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A refrigerator on its side
								</li>
								<li>
									The height of your tall friend
								</li>
								<li>
									2-3 strides
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Wash your hands frequently.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							Soap can break down the protective layer of viruses and wash them away. The process takes 20 seconds.<br/>
							Twenty seconds is like...
							<ul>
								<li>Singing "Happy Birthday" twice</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Lose Yourself" by Eminem twice</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Take on Me" by A-Ha</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees</li>
							</ul>
