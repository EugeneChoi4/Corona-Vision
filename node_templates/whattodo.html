						Here are some things you can do:
					</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Leave a 6-foot space between yourself and others.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							Six feet is like...<br/>
							<ul>
								<li>A refrigerator on its side</li>
								<li>The height of your tall friend</li>
								<li>2-3 strides</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Wash your hands frequently.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							Soap can break down the protective layer of viruses and wash them away. The process takes 20 seconds.<br/>
							Twenty seconds is like...
							<ul>
								<li>Singing "Happy Birthday" twice</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Lose Yourself" by Eminem twice</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Take on Me" by A-Ha</li>
								<li>Singing the chorus to "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Stay home, save lives.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							Staying home prevents the spread of the virus to other people.<br/>
							<ul>
								<li>Even if you don't exhibit symptoms, you may still carry the virus.</li>
								<li>Please limit your daily travel to <b>essential</b> activities, such as grocery shopping.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Don't touch your face.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							This is how the virus enters your body.
						</p>
						<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
							Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.<br/>
						</span>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>When you cough, droplets can spread as far as 20 feet (~6 meters).</li>
								<li>When you sneeze, droplets can spread as far as 25 feet (~8 meters).</li>
							</ul>
